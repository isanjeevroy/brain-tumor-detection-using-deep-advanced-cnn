## Introduction

Brain tumor detection is a critical task in the medical field, requiring precise and timely diagnosis. Traditional diagnostic methods depend heavily on the expertise of radiologists, which can lead to variability in diagnoses. This project utilizes deep learning, specifically CNNs, to automate the detection of brain tumors from MRI scans, providing a rapid, reliable, and objective diagnostic tool.

## Features

- **Automated Brain Tumor Detection**: Quickly identifies and localizes brain tumors from MRI images.
- **Advanced CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a fine-tuned CNN model for high accuracy and generalization.
- **High Performance**: Achieves high accuracy through data augmentation, transfer learning, and model optimization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple interface for easy use by medical professionals.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Offers quick predictions to support real-time decision-making.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for image classification tasks. It consists of the following components:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Several convolutional layers are used to extract features from the input MRI images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Pooling layers are applied after convolutional layers to reduce the spatial dimensions, which helps in reducing the computational complexity.
- **Dropout for Regularization**: Dropout layers are included to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of neurons during training.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers are used for the final classification of the images into tumor and no-tumor categories.
- **Transfer Learning**: The model leverages transfer learning from pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG to enhance performance, especially when the training data is limited. This allows the model to utilize pre-learned features from these models and fine-tune them for brain tumor detection.

This architecture ensures high accuracy and generalization across different datasets, making it effective for real-world medical applications.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of **95%** on the validation set and **94%** on the test set. The high accuracy demonstrates the model's effectiveness in detecting brain tumors from MRI images.

| **Metric**           | **Value** |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Training Accuracy    | 96%       |
